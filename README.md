My wife likes to knit, but doesn't like to drop a stitch. She would like a tool to help her keep track of her progress during a knitting session and when she returns after time away. Using JavaScript logic and HTML+CSS for a simple UI, I built a simple web app utilising the device's local storage to track and save the user's session progress.
